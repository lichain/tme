### How to Build TME

#### CentOS

Tested on CentOS 5 and 6

Prerequisites packages:

* Sun JDK (jdk-1.6.0_21+)
* Apache Ant (1.8.2+)
* GNU g++ (gcc-c++)
* CMake (cmake)
* Boost (boost-devel)
* rpmbuild (rpm-build)

Make sure that the binary executable of ant is included in the search path, and it uses the Sun JDK to build.

Simply run "make rpm" in the top directory, and all the RPM packages of TME will be generated to "output/artifacts"

#### Ubuntu

Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, using OpenJDK should work.

To prepare the build environment:

1. apt-get install git-core
2. apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk
3. apt-get install ant1.8
4. apt-get install g++
5. apt-get install cmake
6. apt-get install libboost-program-options1.40-dev

TME web portal only supports Ruby 1.9.2+, and Ubuntu 10.04 only ships Ruby 1.9.1

You have to follow this step to use RVM to install Ruby 1.9.2:
1. aptitude install build-essential libssl-dev libreadline5 libreadline5-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev
2. bash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)
3. Make 1.9.2 default and do gem install bundler
